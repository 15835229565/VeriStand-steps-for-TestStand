## NI VeriStand Steps for TestStand ##

The **NI VeriStand Steps for TestStand** is a set of custom TestStand step types used to automate NI VeriStand from a TestStand sequence. 

The steps are divided into several groups of steps which provide functionality like project control, channel read/write access, alarms, real-time sequences, logging, and faulting.

The NI VeriStand Steps for TestStand are distributed as *open-source* software and released under the *BSD 2-clause "Simplified" License*. 

### Required Software ###

#### Currently supported NI VeriStand versions ####

* VeriStand 2015 SP1
* VeriStand 2017
* VeriStand 2018

Beginning with version 7.2.2 each package or installer for the NI VeriStand Step Types includes support for *one version of VeriStand* and *all currently supported TestStand versions*. It is **not necessary** to have every version of TestStand installed in order to use the step types.

* TestStand 2014 (32- and 64-bit)
* TestStand 2016 (32- and 64-bit)

For example, the **ni-veristand-2018-steps-for-teststand_7.2.2+001.nipkg** package installs NI VeriStand 2018 compatible step types for all versions of TestStand listed above. 

Beginning with version 7.2.2 the NI VeriStand Step Types are available as an NI Package with the .nipkg file extension. Previous versions were distributed as a LabVIEW Installer.
