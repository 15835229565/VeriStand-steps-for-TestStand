## TestStand steps for VeriStand ##

**TestStand steps for VeriStand** is a set of TestStand step types that makes calling VeriStand simple and easy.  These steps wrap the VeriStand APIs and add a nice user interface to allow for easy configuration.

### Repo Structure ###

Since for the time being it takes a separate set of code to work with a different version of TestStand or LabVIEW, we will fork this repo on a per-version basis.  That is the way that makes the most sense to store it here on github.  The [master repo is here.](https://github.com/NIVeriStandAdd-Ons/VeriStand-steps-for-TestStand)

### LabVIEW Version ###

This source uses LabVIEW 2013 through 2015 (see below for other dependencies)

### Built Availability ###

A built version is [available on ni.com](https://decibel.ni.com/content/docs/DOC-40123)

### Quality, Limitations ###

This is considered reasonably mature code that has been deployed in many systems and refined over several versions.

All of the features in newer versions have not necessarily been added to older versions.  In general, new features have been moved to older versions on an as-needed basis.
